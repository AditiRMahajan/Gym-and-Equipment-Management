# Gym-and-Equipment-Management
We have designed and built a GYM AND EQUIPMENT MANAGEMENT SYSTEM i.e. ‘GEMS FIT’ for smart and sophisticated living. This application avoids the data redundancy that arrives in most of GYM related databases. It is useful for maintaining information about gym in an efficient way. The GEMS FIT will help in maximizing facilities and number of exercises available to people from all generations. It also provides detailed information about the machinery and coaches present in the gym. It is a recreation facility system program that looks after all your members, memberships and activities. It also focusses on maintaining lasting durability and quality life fitness. The reason behind  creating this system is to design and develop a user friendly and easy to use computerized gym management system.
